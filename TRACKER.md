- **Hover Tooltips**: Comprehensive information on hover with topic details, XP, status, and dependencies
- **Cluster Focus Mode**: Click any cluster to isolate it with related dependencies for focused learning
- **Interactive Legend**: Always-accessible help system explaining all visual elements

#### **Gamification Integration** ✅

- **Visual Progress System**: XP stars, completion badges, and streak indicators prominently displayed
- **Goal Path Highlighting**: Yellow glowing paths show the route to your learning target
- **Achievement Animations**: Satisfying completion and unlock animations with proper timing
- **Cluster Completion**: Visual feedback for cluster mastery with medal-style indicators

#### **Aesthetic & Inspiration** ✅

- **Civilization Tech Tree Feel**: Parchment-like backgrounds, professional node design, strategic game aesthetics
- **Modern Flat Design**: Clean, uncluttered interface with subtle depth and shadows
- **Consistent Visual Language**: Unified color schemes, typography, and interaction patterns
