Backlog (For Post-Phase Iteration)
Deep search integration for map navigation (original Phase 2 idea).

Alternate map layouts beyond tree view.

Color-coding enhancements for complex dependencies.

Advanced analytics (time spent per topic, learning velocity).

Multiplayer/mentorship modes.

Future Enhancements (Backlog – Not for this iteration):

Convex Hull Polygon — dynamic outline hugging card edges for organic shapes.

Blurred Bubble — subtle Gaussian blur effect for a softer grouping style.

Label Positioning Variants — experimenting with label inside vs. outside cluster bounds.
